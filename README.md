# Colour Game by Dmitriy Kim and Thiha Min Thein.

# Description of the project.
    The project is a interactive web game, where the user will need to guess which tiles
    have the most dominant color. The color is chosen before the game is started. They will also
    need to choose a name, a board size and finally a difficulty. They need to meet the requirements,
    for instance, not having a name under 5 characters, a board size that is 3 to 7 included, etc. Depending 
    on how they have done, they will get a percentage that they need to pass, and then will be added to the highscore, 
    with their name and the score given by the game. Also, if they user tries to select more tiles than the target amount, it's an automatic 0. they will then be able to play again later on. 
    An important note is if two names that are the same were to be added to the highscore table, the scores will be merged. 
    So, it is important to not have the same username as another, unless you love seeing others win.

# How to run the project.
    It is pretty simple, the user needs to first select a name, a board size, a color and then a difficulty.
    Afterwards, they will need to click the generate button if the user passes the requirements. Nextup, the game
    table will appear, where the user can select tiles and deselect them as well. After making the guesses,
    the user may submit, and read the alart that pops up. Finally, the user will then be able to play again and repeat
    the steps, and if they want, clear the highscore table using the 'clear' button.
